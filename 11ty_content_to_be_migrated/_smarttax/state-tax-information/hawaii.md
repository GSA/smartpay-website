### Purchase Card

#### Notes

The State of Hawaii does not assess state sales tax on consumers.  Instead, the state assesses GET on businesses for the sale of goods.

Notes for the GET:

* Businesses have the ability to pass along the GET to cardholders.
* If a business sells goods to the federal government, the sale is exempt and the business may claim a deduction.
* Should the vendor not claim a deduction, the assessment of GET is allowable as it is not a state sales tax.
