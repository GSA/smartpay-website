[FAR 4.606(a)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-48/chapter-1/subchapter-A/part-4/subpart-4.6/section-4.606) requires the GSA Center for Charge Card Management to provide summary government-wide purchase account data on an annual basis. 

We developed the GSA SmartPayÂ® Purchase Card Statistics Report to report this data to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS).
