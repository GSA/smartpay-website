Through the [GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract](https://smartpay.gsa.gov/content/master-contract), the GSA SmartPay program provides agencies/organizations with a comprehensive portfolio of purchase, travel, fleet and integrated payment solutions to support mission needs.

Agencies/organizations issue a task order under the GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract to one of the GSA SmartPay contractor banks, Citibank or U.S. Bank. Then, the awarded bank provides payment solutions to the agency.

GSA SmartPay transactions involve the account holder, chosen payment solution, acquiring bank, issuing bank, brand network, and merchant.

In addition, the graphic and glossary below detail the steps and define the participants that play a role in GSA SmartPay transactions.

![How a GSA SmartPay Transaction works:  Step 1: An account holder uses a GSA SmartPay solution as a method of procurement and payment for the authorized purchase of goods and services. Step 2: The acquiring bank receives authorization from the issuing bank through the brand network (VISA or Mastercard). Step 3: The merchant finalizes the transaction and the acquiring bank requests payment from the issuing bank through the brand network. Step 4: Once approved, the issuing bank provides funds to the acquiring bank through the brand network. The brand assesses an interchange fee on the approved amount. Step 5: The acquiring bank assesses a processing fee on the approved funds and the merchant receives payment. Step 6: The issuing bank bills the account holder for the full amount of the goods and/or services purchased.]({{ '/assets/img/how-smartpay-transactions-work.jpg' | url }})

## Glossary
**Account Holder:** An individual issued an account at the request of an agency/organization.

**Merchant:** The entity accepting payment from an agency/organization in exchange for goods/services. The merchant may be a required source inside or outside the federal government, another government agency or a private sector merchant of supplies or services.

**Acquiring Bank:** A financial institution that processes GSA SmartPay account payments on behalf of a merchant. It allows merchants to accept payments from the issuing bank within the authorization network.

**Issuing Bank:** A financial institution that issues GSA SmartPay accounts to account holders and is responsible for paying the acquiring bank for the goods/services purchased.

**Interchange Fee:** A fee paid by the merchant’s financial institutions to the card issuing bank for processing its customer merchant payment transaction. In most instances, the interchange fee is a percentage of the total transaction amount and is passed on to the merchant through its financial institution’s fees.

**Brand Network:** A financial institution that dictates where payments can be processed and facilitates the payment process between account holders, merchants, and issuing financial institutions.

**Processing Fee:** A percentage-based fee charged by the acquiring bank to the merchant on every payment processed.
