## The U.S. Constitution

The [Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript) establishes that the U.S. Constitution and federal laws are “the Supreme Law of the Land.” As such, states cannot impose sales tax on the federal government.

## Supreme Court Decisions
Several high court judicial rulings have established this legal precedent, which include but are not limited to the following:

    <div class="grid-col-6 margin-bottom-2">Taxes assessed to entities doing business with the federal government is not the same as directly assessing taxes to the federal government.</div>

      <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/455/720/">U.S. v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720 (1982)</a>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-col-6">Immunity from taxes cannot be conferred to entities that are doing business with or on behalf of the federal government.</div>
  </div>
</div>

## Payment Liability
Rulings were based on liability for payment; if the federal government is directly responsible for payment, states cannot assess a sales or use tax. Federal employees who are traveling on business or who are making work-related purchases may or may not be subject to state taxes. States may be able to determine whether to apply taxes to federal government transactions.
