## Forms

### Purchase Card

#### Notes

No forms are required, however the federal government is only exempt from specific types of transactions in New Mexico. CBAs are not subject to gross receipts taxes on tangible property but are eligible for intangible property (e.g., lodging).  Cardholders should be able to present the CBA card, which must indicate â€œUnited States of America," however merchants can request a Type 9 nontaxable transaction certificate.
