The most reliable method of identifying GSA SmartPay purchase and fleet charge cards is through the 4 digit Bank Identification Number (BIN). In order to recognize GSA SmartPay travel, tax advantage and integrated cards, please refer to the 6 digit BIN.

## Travel Account

**What is the GSA SmartPay Travel Account?**

The GSA SmartPay Travel Account can be used for official government travel and travel-related expenses, while allowing account holders access to GSA City Pair Program reduced airfares. Agency/organizations are able to reduce travel processing costs and earn refunds as annual spend has nearly tripled since the program’s inception in 1998. GSA SmartPay Travel Account revenue funds the GSA City Pair reduced cost airline ticket program.

**Travel Accounts:**

Some states provide tax exemption on individually billed travel accounts (IBAs). To determine whether the travel or integrated account is a CBA, IBA, or Tax Advantage Travel Account, refer to the 6th digit of the account number. Please note, the 6th digit identifier that differentiates CBA and IBA accounts is specific to Travel accounts only and does not apply to other GSA SmartPay business lines.

Travel cards may have two different designs:

  <div class="grid-row grid-gap">
    <div class="grid-col-4">
      <img
      src="{{ '/assets/img/vector/smartpay-blue-travel-plain.svg' | url }}"
      alt="blue travel card"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-col-4">
      <img
      src="{{ '/assets/img/vector/smartpay-silver-advantage-plain.svg' | url }}"
      alt="silver travel card"/>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


GSA SmartPay travel account prefixes include

- Visa: 4486, 4614, 4716
- MC: 5565 and 5568

**The Sixth Digit Identifies Billing Type:**

Note: 6th digit identifiers for IBAs apply to the travel business line only.



**Tax Exemption Status**

Federal government travelers using IBA GSA SmartPay travel accounts may be exempt from state taxes in select states. In addition, state tax exemption forms, official business travel documentation or a federal government identification may be required to receive state tax exemption.

**Best Practices**

- If the state exempts taxes, determine what additional information is required (tax exemption form, official travel documentation or a federal government identification) out and bring it with you on travel
- When traveling to a sales tax exempt state, contact the hotel before you travel to verify that taxes will not be charged to your GSA SmartPay travel account
- If the hotel does not recognize tax exemption status, please refer hotel representatives to the state’s taxation authority to verify tax exemption status
- Maintain copies of all receipts in order to verify taxes assessed; receipts should be maintained for six years and three months (or to length of agency’s policy)
- In accordance with the Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998 (PL 105-264), please use the GSA SmartPay travel account when you are on official federal government travel. States will not exempt taxes on personal accounts and your agency will not have the ability to earn important refunds.
