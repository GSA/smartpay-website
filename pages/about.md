Established in 1998, the GSA SmartPay Program is the world’s largest government charge card and commercial payment solutions program, providing services to more than 560 Federal agencies, organizations, and Native American tribal governments. GSA SmartPay payment solutions enable authorized government employees to make purchases on behalf of the Federal Government in support of their agency/organization’s mission.

Prior to using a GSA SmartPay payment solution, the Federal Government used traditional paper-based payment processes such as purchase orders for small dollar purchases (under the micro-purchase threshold).  In many cases, traditional paper-based processing techniques cost more to process than the amount of the transaction itself.  The inefficiency, costs and risks associated with these processes were a key factor in the dramatic increase in the use of GSA SmartPay payment solutions.

GSA SmartPay payment solutions:

* Streamline transaction processing;
* Increase accountability; and
* Provide a more efficient and effective means to monitor transactions and identify fraud, waste, and abuse.

The GSA Center for Charge Card Management (CCCM) and GSA SmartPay contractor banks are dedicated to identifying opportunities to provide customers with GSA SmartPay solutions to help address agency payment challenges.  CCCM seeks to increase awareness of available payment solutions under the GSA SmartPay master contract and help agencies continue to find ways to increase payment efficiencies and earn refunds.  In the current budgetary environment, CCCM is committed to providing information to agency executives and card managers to identify innovative ways to help realize cost savings.
