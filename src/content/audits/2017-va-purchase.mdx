## Background

The Office of Inspector General conducted this review in response to allegations that Dublin VAMC purchase cardholders split purchases and made duplicate payments to Ryland Contracting Incorporated and Sterilizer Technical Specialists.

## Recommendations

The OIG recommended that:

- The Veterans Integrated Service Network 7 Director reviews transactions for unauthorized commitments, submits ratification requests, emphasizes the importance of monitoring cardholders, provides training and ensures Approving Officials do not exceed the limit of assigned cardholders. 
- The Director ensures contracts are established in accordance with VHA policy and takes appropriate administrative action for each cardholder who made unauthorized commitments.
