## Background

The DHS has established internal controls for its charge card programs. Components did not always follow DHS’s required procedures for credit card use. In addition, components did not always have their own procedures in place to supplement those developed by DHS.

## Recommendations

The OIG recommend that the Assistant Director for Bankcard and Review, DHS Office of the Chief Financial Officer:

- Ensure components implement purchase card procedures based on the _DHS Purchase Card Manual_.
