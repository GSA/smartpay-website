## Background

DoD cardholders who used government travel cards at casinos and adult entertainment establishments for personal use sought or received reimbursement for their charges.

## Recommendations

The OIG recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence:

- Report travel card misuse under investigation to the appropriate facility and the report outcome of the investigation.
- Report misuse of travel cards in a timely manner on individuals without a security clearance.

The OIG also recommended that the Director, Defense Travel Management Office:

- Improve the identification of personal use of the travel card and disciplinary actions taken by revising the “Government Travel Charge Card Regulations.”
