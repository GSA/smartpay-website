## Background

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) selected six agencies based on contract obligations for 2017 and 2018 disasters. GAO analyzed federal procurement and agency data, reviewed agencies’ policies on workforce planning, purchase card use, and fraud risk and analyzed purchase card data. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was not included in the  examination of workforce planning due to prior GAO work.

## Recommendations

GAO made 12 recommendations, including:

- To three agencies – Assess disaster response contracting needs in workforce planning.
- To five agencies – Assess fraud risk for purchase card use in support of disaster response.
