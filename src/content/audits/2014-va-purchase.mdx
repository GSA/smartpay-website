## Background

VA’s Office of Inspector General Hotline Division received an allegation that Engineering Service employees at the Ralph H. Johnson, VA Medical Center (VAMC), Charleston, SC, were splitting purchases to circumvent the $3,000 micro-purchase limit.

## Recommendations

The OIG recommended the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 7 Director:

- Review Charleston VAMC Engineering Service’s purchase card transactions for unauthorized commitments and purchases lacking sufficient documentation and process necessary ratification and payment recovery actions. 
- Improve purchase card practices by implementing monitoring mechanisms that ensure improved oversight and providing sufficient training.
