## Background

GAO examined what actions GSA and OMB have taken since 2008 to enhance program controls over micro-purchases and whether weaknesses exist in the approval process for them and, if so, whether there were indicators of improper or potentially fraudulent purchases.

## Recommendations

It was recommended that GSA:

- Reemphasize OMB guidance to obtain and retain complete documentation of micro-purchases. 
- Require cardholders to document purchase request and preapproval for self generated purchases.
