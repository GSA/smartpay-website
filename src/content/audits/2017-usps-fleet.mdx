## Background

This fleet specialty credit card is issued to each facility with assigned vehicles and to Vehicle Maintenance Facilities (VMF) to pay for maintenance or repairs over $300.  Controls over fleet specialty credit cards in the Eastern Area were not always effective.

## Recommendations

The OIG recommended that management:

- Issue a directive instructing site managers to ensure fleet specialty credit card transactions and related supporting documentation are reviewed at least monthly, maintained for 2 years, and provided to the appropriate VMFs. 
- Direct all site managers to follow fleet specialty credit card guidance to properly manage and secure PINs and fleet specialty credit cards.
