## Background

According to U.S. Bank, DOT employees made more than 327,000 purchase card transactions—totaling $223.7 million—from October 2016 through March 2018. The objectives of this audit were to:

- Test existing controls to determine if they provide reasonable assurance that improper purchases are prevented or detected in the normal course of business.
- Evaluate DOT’s policies and procedures for oversight of its purchase card program.

## Recommendations

Thirteen recommendations were made to assist DOT in improving its oversight of the purchase card program and increasing the effectiveness of its internal controls, including:
- Develop procedures to ensure purchase card records are complete.
- Implement procedures to ensure cardholders retain records in accordance with the National Archives and Records Administration’s (NARA) general records schedule. 
- Update purchase card guidance to include appropriate language that states that purchase cards cannot be used to pay for unauthorized commitments without appropriate documentation.
- Develop procedures to ensure purchase card files are complete. 
- Develop and implement controls to ensure that all trainings are administered timely in FAA’s electronic learning management system, and ensure cardholders complete refresher training in a timely manner.
- Establish procedures to enforce the suspension of purchasing authority for cardholders that do not satisfy the refresher training requirement.
- Reiterate the importance of following the employee closeout and clearance process to Purchase Cardholders, Approving Officials and Agency Program Coordinators, when a cardholder separates from the agency or the purchase card program.
- Develop and implement a process to monitor purchase transactions that involve credits to ensure the follow-up is performed and credits are received timely.
