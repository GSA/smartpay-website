## Background

The federal government faces a long-term, unsustainable fiscal path based on an imbalance between federal revenues and spending. While addressing this structural imbalance will require fiscal policy changes, in the near term opportunities exist to take action in a number of areas to improve this situation, including where federal programs or activities are fragmented, overlapping, or duplicative. To call attention to these opportunities, Congress included a provision in statute for GAO to identify and report on federal programs, agencies, offices and initiatives—either within departments or governmentwide—that have duplicative goals or activities.

## Recommendations

In this report, GAO presents 79 new actions that Congress or executive branch agencies could take across 29 new areas. Of these, they suggest 26 actions to address 15 areas in which they found evidence of fragmentation, overlap or duplication in government missions and functions.
