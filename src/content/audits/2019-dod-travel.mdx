## Background

This report examines the amount DoD spent on Defense Travel System (DTS) travel payments for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and how much of those payments DoD estimated to be improper.

## Recommendations

GAO made five recommendations to DoD, suggesting that they consider:

- Data on improper payment rates in its remediation approach.
- Defining the term “root cause”.
- Cost effectiveness in deciding how to address improper payments.
