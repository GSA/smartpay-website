## Background

The objective of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) purchase card initiative was to analyze and review government purchase card data to determine the risks associated with purchase card transactions.

## Recommendations

It was recommended that:

- To strengthen monitoring and oversight of purchase cards, OMB should remind agencies of their responsibilities over purchase card activities as detailed in OMB Circular No. A-123.
- Agencies should take steps to improve controls such as training, policies and procedures, separation of duties, and supervisory reviews to mitigate risks from potentially illegal, improper or erroneous transactions.
