## Background

The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted this audit of NSA’s travel program because of the inherent risk related to reimbursing travel expenses using government travel charge cards.

## Recommendations

The OIG found that improvements are needed to ensure that:

- Individually billed travel card accounts are properly monitored.
- Centrally billed travel charge card accounts are reconciled.
- Former Agency military affiliates’ travel charge card accounts are closed.
- Travel and Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) training is provided to agency employees.
- Airline travel claims are submitted in a way that mitigates risk.
- An integrated travel modernization strategy is effectively developed.

A total of 10 recommendations were made to the agency in addressing these concerns.
