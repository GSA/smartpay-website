## Background

The administration and GSA have encouraged agencies to take steps to adopt cost-savings efforts and promote efficient travel spending.

## Recommendations

GAO recommended that the GSA Administrator work with the Senior Travel Official Council (STOC) to:

- Develop a travel data management approach that would provide GSA with more consistent travel cost data.
- As chair of the STOC, identify and implement promising practices to help agencies leverage travel resources and achieve cost savings.
