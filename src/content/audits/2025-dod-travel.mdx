## (U) Background

(U) According to the General Services Administration SmartPayÂ® statistics, during FY 2023, the DoD GTCC program spent $6.4 billion on 2.3 million open individually
billed accounts and 9,416 open centrally billed accounts. The VICM system is a web-based tool which provides the DoD with automated compliance analysis,
recordkeeping for GTCC transactions, and identification and tracking of potential misuse, abuse, and policy violations.

## (U) Recommendations

(U) We made 15 recommendations to the Director, Defense Support Services Center, requiring the DTMO to review, update, and create the VICM rules and settings to
identify high-risk merchants and transactions and ensure that CPMs and APCs use the VICM system.

**Note:** Please refer to the Recommendations Table for the latest status of the recommendations.
