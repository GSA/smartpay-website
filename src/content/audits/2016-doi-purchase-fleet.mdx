## Background

The audit was conducted to determine whether internal controls for the Integrated Charge Card Program (ICCP) are adequately designed and appropriately implemented to effectively deter fraud, waste or abuse.

## Recommendations

The OIG provided 10 recommendations to help improve management and oversight of the ICCP, including:

- Develop internal controls and increase accountability actions so that cardholders and AOs review statements and attach supporting documents. 
- Recover the cost of any illegal, improper or erroneous purchases. 
- Conduct recurring management reviews of charge card transactions and clearly demonstrate actions taken when deficiencies are identified. 
- Establish internal controls designed to identify purchases exceeding authorized limits. 
- Issue final guidance on the professional services exemption from micro-purchase limits that reflects the Department of Labor regulations.
- Develop and implement internal control procedures needed to ensure purchase logs are properly documented, maintained and current. 
- Instruct cardholders and AOs regarding the authorized uses of convenience checks and take appropriate actions for those who do not comply with policy. 
- Close cardholder accounts before employees separate to prevent fraudulent use. 
- Establish a department-wide systematic review process for assigning Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) restricted groups. 
- Verify the accuracy of MCCs and verify that appropriate restrictions have been placed on purchase card accounts.
