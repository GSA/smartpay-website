## Background

The GPC program is for official Government purchases of supplies, goods, and services under the micro-purchase threshold, which increased from $10,000 to $20,000 for domestic purchases and to $35,000 for purchases outside of the United States for COVID-19 purchases. From March 2020 through January 2022, DoD GPC cardholders made 110,525 purchases, valued at $242.6 million, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Recommendations

We recommend that the Principal Director, Defense Pricing
and Contracting, in coordination with DoD Component
Program Managers:
- Re-emphasize the importance of tracking, reviewing, and reporting Government Purchase Card transactions made in support of contingency operations.
- Develop and implement a process to review, at least semiannually for each ongoing contingency operation, the Components’ follow up reviews to ensure these reviews are conducted and are effective.
- Develop and implement a plan of action to make program improvements that address the oversight deficiencies identified in this report related to card.
