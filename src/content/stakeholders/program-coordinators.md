As an A/OPC, you serve as the liaison between your agency, the contractor bank, the card/account holder, and the GSA Contracting Officer. Your role is essential to efficiently and effectively managing your agency’s GSA SmartPay program.

Here are some potential A/OPC responsibilities, which may vary by agency:

- Maintain an up-to-date list of account names, card/account numbers, addresses, emails, telephone numbers, etc. of all current card/account holders and cards/accounts.
- Provide the contractor bank with any changes in your agency's organizational structure that may affect invoice/report distribution.
- Review and evaluate the contractor's technical and administrative task order performance and compliance.
- Resolve problems between the contractor bank and card/account holders.
- Take appropriate action regarding delinquent accounts by reporting violations to internal investigative units and the GSA Contracting Officer.
- Participate in the annual GSA SmartPay Training Forum and train card/account holders.
- Ensure card/account holders use their card/account correctly.
- Monitor card/account activity and manage delinquencies.
- Ensure that appropriate steps are taken to mitigate suspension or cancellation actions.
- Develop agency program procedures and policies as necessary.
- Keep the lines of communication open with all key program participants.

Communication is key. A/OPCs should ensure that all program participants, including senior management/leadership, are aware of what is going on in the program. Keep in touch with your program’s participants by networking, asking questions, and sharing or distributing policy changes and program information.

As an A/OPC, you should try to establish relationships with the card/account holders and Approving Officials (AOs) within your span of control. The better you understand why and how the GSA SmartPay card/account will be used, the more effective you can be in managing the program.
