The account holder is responsible for:

- Securing the account.
- Maintaining records relating to all transactions.
- Using the account ethically and appropriately.
- Observing all dollar limits.
- Reconciling and documenting transactions.

Account holders must comply with all applicable regulations and procedures of your agency. If you’re unsure about a purchase or you’re unclear about your agency’s policy, please reach out to your agency/organization’s program coordinator (A/OPC) for guidance.

Account holders are also responsible for reporting a lost or stolen GSA SmartPay account. If this occurs, please promptly contact the following parties:

- The contractor bank.
- Your A/OPC.
- Your supervisor.

Once an account has been reported as lost or stolen, the contractor bank immediately blocks that account from further usage and a new account number will be issued to the account holder.
