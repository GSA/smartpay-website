The federal government issued an [interim rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/05/2023-21320/federal-acquisition-regulation-implementation-of-federal-acquisition-supply-chain-security-act) that amends the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement supply chain risk information sharing and FASCSA orders. This rule became effective on December 4, 2023.

## Accessing FASCSA Orders
[The System for Award Management (SAM)](https://sam.gov) is an official website of the U.S. Government that helps users navigate the federal award lifecycle. 

The site stores FASCSA order data entered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).

Before making any purchase, including GSA SmartPay Purchase card/account transactions, agency officials should go to [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov) and select the â€œView FASCSA Orders" button to download and review a complete list of the FASCSA orders.

Buyers should:
- Be sure to follow their agency rules and procedures for compliance with applicable FASCSA orders to determine whether the purchase should be made. 
- Keep in mind that the FASCSA order review should take place for all purchases at any dollar threshold.
- Note that until DHS, DoD, or DNI create the first FASCSA order in [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov), the downloaded file will be empty.
