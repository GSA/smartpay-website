The General Services Administration (GSA) – in partnership with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) – has joined the Department of Defense (DoD) in developing tools to assist card/account holders with finding Section 889 representations.

Section 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 ([P.L. 115-232 [PDF, 789 pages]](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ232/PLAW-115publ232.pdf)) and the [Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Case 2018-017](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/13/2019-17201/federal-acquisition-regulation-prohibition-on-contracting-for-certain-telecommunications-and-video) prohibit the purchase of covered telecommunications equipment and services from vendors who sell products containing spyware. These devices could pose a threat to U.S. security by spying on or disrupting communications within the U.S.

## Section 889 Easy Search Tool


- The [Section 889 Easy Search Tool](https://889.smartpay.gsa.gov/) checks for Section 889 representations in a vendor's System for Award Management (SAM) record at [SAM.gov](http://www.sam.gov). 
- Only vendors doing business above the micro-purchase threshold (MPT) are required to register in [SAM.gov](http://www.SAM.gov).
- Contracts that are For Official Use Only (FOUO) or classified, and contractors that do not wish for their information to be publicly available, will not show up in search results. 
- If a vendor representation is not available, card/account holders may still be permitted to purchase from a listed vendor. However, the card/account holder would be responsible for documenting compliance with Section 889 in accordance with agency requirements.

## DoD’s Section 889 Request Bot 

- This tool is a robotic process automation (RPA) capability developed by DoD’s Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC). 
- To learn a vendor’s 889 information, users email [info@section889request.com](mailto:info@section889request.com)  with the vendor’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code or Unique Entity ID (UEI) in the subject line. Please note that:
    * For CAGE code requests, ensure that the email subject line is exactly 5 characters long. 
    * For UEI requests, ensure that the email subject line is exactly 12 characters long.
    * To avoid error messages, do not include additional text in the email’s subject line or in the body of the email.
- After sending a request, users will generally receive an email response from [info@section889req.com](mailto:info@section889req.com) within five minutes. 
- The email response identifies if the vendor is registered in SAM, if they have completed the representations required by the [FAR 52.204-26](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.204-26) provision and what responses were provided. 
- This capability gives Contracting Officers and users a quick way to check SAM.
