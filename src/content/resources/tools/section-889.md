The General Services Administration (GSA) – in partnership with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) – has joined the Department of Defense (DoD) in developing tools to assist card/account holders with finding Section 889 representations.

Section 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 ([P.L. 115-232 [PDF, 789 pages]](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ232/PLAW-115publ232.pdf)) and the [Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Case 2018-017](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/13/2019-17201/federal-acquisition-regulation-prohibition-on-contracting-for-certain-telecommunications-and-video) prohibit the purchase of covered telecommunications equipment and services from vendors who sell products containing spyware. These devices could pose a threat to U.S. security by spying on or disrupting communications within the U.S.

## GSA's Section 889 Easy Search Tool


- The [Section 889 Easy Search Tool](https://889.smartpay.gsa.gov/) checks for Section 889 representations in a vendor's System for Award Management (SAM) record at [SAM.gov](http://www.sam.gov). 
- Only vendors doing business above the micro-purchase threshold (MPT) are required to register in [SAM.gov](http://www.SAM.gov).
- Contracts that are For Official Use Only (FOUO) or classified, and contractors that do not wish for their information to be publicly available, will not show up in search results. 
- If a vendor representation is not available, card/account holders may still be permitted to purchase from a listed vendor. However, the card/account holder would be responsible for documenting compliance with Section 889 in accordance with agency requirements.

## DoD’s Contracting Assistant for Awards and Micro-Purchases (CAAMP) Bot 


- The CAAMP bot, formerly known as the Section 889 Request bot, is a robotic process automation (RPA) capability developed by DoD’s Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy (DPCAP).
- To obtain a vendor’s 889 representation and other vendor details, email ‘osd.section889request@mail.mil’ with the vendor’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code or Unique Entity ID (UEI) in the subject line. Please note that:
    * For CAGE code requests, ensure that the email subject line is exactly 5 characters long. 
    * For UEI requests, ensure that the email subject line is exactly 12 characters long.
    * To avoid error messages, do not include additional text in the email’s subject line or in the body of the email.
- After sending a request, users will receive an email response from ‘osd.section889request@mail.mil’ within ten minutes.
- The email response identifies if the vendor is registered in SAM if they have completed representations required by FAR 52.204-26 provision and what responses were provided. CAAMP also now provides vendor representations for FAR 52.219-1, FAR 9.405, and FAR 8.7 provisions.
- This capability gives Contracting Officers, Purchase Card Holders, and other users a quick way to check SAM.
