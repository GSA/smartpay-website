- Replacements for lost, stolen, broken or otherwise unusable cards will be sent within 48 hours of the request.
- In the case of an emergency, such as response to a natural disaster, threat to national security, or military mobilization, the contractor bank will send the GSA SmartPay account within 24 hours of the request.
