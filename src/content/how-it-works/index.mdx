Agencies/organizations issue a task order under the [GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract](/about/master-contract) to one of the GSA SmartPay contractor banks, Citibank or U.S. Bank. Then, the awarded bank provides payment solutions to the agency.

GSA SmartPay transactions involve the card/account holder, chosen payment solution, acquiring bank, issuing bank, brand network, and merchant.
