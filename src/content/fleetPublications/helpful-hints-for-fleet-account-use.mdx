## The GSA SmartPay® Fleet Account

In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.301, the governmentwide commercial fleet account is authorized for the purchase of fuel, maintenance and
repair of government owned/operated motor vehicles, aircraft, boats, and motorized equipment. Fleet accounts are typically issued for specific vehicles rather than to persons.

Having this account provides your agency/organization with numerous benefits. With these benefits come certain responsibilities for you. This booklet is intended as a quick reference for “Dos and Don’ts” to using
the fleet account. It also provides helpful information about the account.

## Account Holder Responsibilities Do’s:

You are the government’s agent for each purchase made with the fleet account and responsible for each transaction. In addition
to the responsibilities listed here, you must comply with all applicable regulations and procedures of your agency/organization
and the agency/organization providing the equipment.

- Do keep the account safe and secure.
- Do purchase regular unleaded self-service gasoline from service stations that offer the lowest price, except when the vehicle requires diesel or alternative fuel or under other authorized conditions.
- Do use the account to purchase oil, fluids, and other necessary maintenance and repairs only as authorized.
- Do observe all dollar limits for purchases.
- Do seek state tax exemption for all non-fuel purchases.
- Do use the account ethically.
- Do immediately report a lost or stolen account to your Fleet Manager or Fleet Service Representative and the issuing bank.
- Do destroy any lost or stolen cards that are recovered.
- Do be aware of identity theft schemes attempting to gain access to financial information.
- Do be aware that misuse of the fleet account could result in disciplinary actions by your agency.

## Account Holder Responsibilities Don'ts:

- Don't use the fleet account to purchase food, beverages, or other items for personal use.
- Don't use an old fleet account that was replaced for any reason.
- Don't use a fleet account assigned to another vehicle.
- Don't use a fleet account at a pump that appears to be tampered with or looks suspicious.

Your feet account may only be used for your agency vehicles. For vehicles leased through GSA Fleet, the GSA Fleet Services Card is used.

If you are uncertain as to whether a purchase is appropriate, ask your Fleet Manager or Fleet Service Representative. Your agency/ organization may have additional restrictions for the use of the account.

## Reporting a Lost or Stolen Account

**Immediately** report a lost or stolen fleet account to the Fleet Manager or Fleet Service Representative and the issuing bank.
The bank will assign a new account number and mail a replacement card to you within one business day from the time the theft or loss was reported.
