## Purchase Card Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) Reports

[FAR 4.606(a)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-48/chapter-1/subchapter-A/part-4/subpart-4.6/section-4.606) requires the GSA Center for Charge Card Management (CCCM) to provide the Government purchase card data, at a minimum annually, and GSA will incorporate that data into FPDS for reports. Currently the Government purchase card data is not being reported into FPDS. Instead, the data is posted here on the GSA SmartPay website. Please contact gsa_smartpay@gsa.gov with questions related to this FAR 4.606(a)(2) reporting requirement.
