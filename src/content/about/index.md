Established in 1998, the GSA SmartPay program provides payment solution services to more than 250 federal agencies/organizations and Native American tribal governments. 

These payment solutions:
- Enable authorized employees to make purchases on behalf of the federal government in support of their agency’s mission.
- Streamline transaction processing.
- Increase accountability.
- Provide a more efficient and effective means to monitor transactions and to identify fraud, waste, and abuse.

The GSA Center for Charge Card Management (CCCM) and GSA SmartPay contractor banks are dedicated to identifying opportunities to provide customers with GSA SmartPay solutions to help address agency payment challenges.

CCCM seeks to increase awareness of available payment solutions under the [GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract](/about/master-contract/) and help agencies continue to find ways to increase payment efficiencies, earn refunds, and identify innovative ways to improve cost savings.
