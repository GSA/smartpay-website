## Cost Savings Realized

Customers have the opportunity to realize administrative cost savings through payment efficiencies. In FY22 alone, the estimated administrative savings for the purchase card was $1.34 billion per year ($70 per transaction) when used in place of a written purchase order. In addition, agencies pay no direct fees to use GSA SmartPay solutions.

## Agency Refunds

Agencies have the opportunity to earn refunds based on the dollar volume of transactions and the speed of payment.

## Safety and Transparency

The GSA SmartPay program provides secure solutions for efficient payment transactions. Customers also have access to tools that provide increased transparency to spend and performance data.

## Electronic Access to Data

Through the Electronic Access System (EAS) of the GSA SmartPay contractor banks, account managers and account holders have immediate access to complete transaction-level data, helping to mitigate fraud, waste and abuse.

## Worldwide Acceptance

Through the use of commercial payment infrastructure, customers are able to use GSA SmartPay solutions anywhere in the world where merchants accept cards.

## Identification for Discount Programs

GSA SmartPay solutions provide automatic point-of-sale recognition for many GSA discount programs, including [Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative](https://www.gsa.gov/buy-through-us/purchasing-programs/federal-strategic-sourcing-initiative-fssi) (FSSI), the [GSA City Pair Program](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/transportation-airfare-rates-pov-rates-etc/city-pair-program-cpp) (CPP) and more.

## Other Benefits

GSA SmartPay payment solutions provide other, less tangible benefits, including travel insurance and eliminating the need for imprest funds or petty cash at the agency.
