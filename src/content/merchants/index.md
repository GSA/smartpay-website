Merchants, please note that:

- If a merchant currently accepts Visa, Mastercard, Voyager and/or Wright Express (WEX), they are already set up to accept GSA SmartPay cards/accounts.
- If a merchant does not currently accept charge cards, they may consider contacting their financial institution to discuss accepting charge cards.
- The transaction fees negotiated with the bank to accept cards from the private sector will also apply to government purchases.

For more information on how to recognize GSA SmartPay card/account types and business lines, please view the [SmartTax Merchant Guide](/merchants/vendor-guide).

For common merchant questions about the GSA SmartPay program, please visit the [FAQs section](/faq/#merchants) of this website or contact the GSA Center for Charge Card Management (CCCM) at [gsa_smartpay@gsa.gov](mailto:gsa_smartpay@gsa.gov).
