## Forms

### Purchase Card

* [Transaction Privilege Tax Exemption Certificate](https://azdor.gov/forms/tpt-forms/tpt-exemption-certificate-general)

#### Notes

In addition to a state use tax assessed to the cardholder, the State of Arizona can also assess a transaction privilege tax on the merchant.

Notes for the transaction privilege tax:

* All merchants doing business in the State of Arizona are subject to the transaction privilege tax.
* Merchants doing business with the federal government, where a CBA is used in the transaction, can request an exemption from the transaction privilege tax.
* The merchant is not required to process the exemption form.
* Should the merchant choose not to request an exemption, the state allows the transaction privilege tax to be passed along from the merchant to the cardholder.
* This is allowable, as the transaction privilege tax is not a state sales tax.
