## The GSA SmartPay® Travel Account

The Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-264) mandates Federal Government account holders to use the contractor-issued travel account1 for official government travel expenses. 

Having this account provides your agency/ organization with numerous benefits and certain responsibilities. This document is intended as a quick reference for “Dos and Don'ts” to using your travel account. It also provides helpful information about your account.

## Account Holder Responsibilities Do's:

In addition to your agency's travel policy, you should comply with the following guidelines: 
 - Do use your government travel account to pay for official travel expenses. 
 - Do review tax exemption information before traveling to determine whether the state provides exemption and if you need to complete any forms. 
 - Do track your expenses and keep receipts while on travel so you have accurate information for filing your travel claim. 
 - Do file your travel claim within five days after you complete your trip or every 30 days if you are on continuous travel. 
 - Do submit payment in full for each monthly bill. 
 - Do follow your bank's dispute process for charges that are incorrect. 
 - Do contact your bank's customer service number if you have questions about your monthly bill. 
 - Do be aware that misuse of the travel account could result in disciplinary actions by your agency. 
 - Do be aware that failure to pay your bill in a timely manner can result in suspension or cancellation of your account and could affect your personal credit rating. 
 - Do contact your Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC) for proper guidance on destroying your card if you leave your agency or retire. 
 - Do immediately report your lost or stolen account to your A/OPC and the issuing bank. 
 - Do destroy any lost or stolen cards that are recovered. 
 - Do be aware of identity theft schemes attempting to gain access to financial information. 
 - Do check with your A/OPC and/or agency policy before using your travel account to cover local travel expenses.

## Account Holder Responsibilities Don'ts:
 - Don't use your travel account for personal use.
 - Don't obtain travel advances through the ATM which exceed your expected out of pocket expenditures for a trip.
 - Don't obtain travel advances through the ATM unless you are on travel or will be on travel shortly.
 - Don't allow your monthly bill to become overdue because this could result in suspension or cancellation of your account.
 - Don't wait for receipt of your monthly billing statement to file your travel claim.
 - Don't forget that the account is issued in your name and liability for payment is your responsibility.
 - Don't write your personal identification number (PIN) on your account or carry your PIN in your wallet.
 - Don't use your account to cover the expenses of other government employees (except when sharing transportation, such as a taxi).


## Local Travel Information
The Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) Amendment 2010-02 removed references to local travel and clarified that the FTR applies only when an employee is on temporary duty (TDY) travel. The terms and conditions of the GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract are in compliance with the FTR Amendment. 

The GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract permits agency/organizations to use the travel account. 

Since local travel policies differ by agency, please be sure to check with your agency policy or A/OPC before using your travel account for local travel purposes.

## Paying Your Travel Account Bill
Make payment for all undisputed charges on your travel account bill in full by the statement billing due date, which is 25 to 30 days after the closing date on the billing statement. The due date is printed on the bill.

Failure to pay your monthly bill in a timely manner will result in the loss of your charging privileges. If your account is suspended, you will be unable to use it until your bank receives payment. If your account is cancelled due to non-payment, your delinquency may be reported to credit bureaus, be referred to collection agencies, lead to other collection actions or make you ineligible to receive a new account.

## Reporting a Lost or Stolen Account
Immediately report your lost or stolen travel account to:
 
- Your issuing bank;
- Your A/OPC; and
- Your supervisor.

You will be responsible for those charges made before the travel account was reported lost or stolen. The bank will assign a new account number and mail a replacement card to you within 48 hours form the time the theft or loss was reported.
