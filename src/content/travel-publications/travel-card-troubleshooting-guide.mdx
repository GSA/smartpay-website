## Help! I need to pay my travel card/account bill

The GSA Center for Charge Card Management (CCCM) frequently receives questions from card/account holders about how to pay a travel card/account bill. Here 
are five ways to make sure the bank receives your payments on time:


1. **Use split disbursement (if available at your agency)**

    Split disbursement is defined in the GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract as the process of dividing a travel voucher reimbursement between the contractor (i.e. the bank) and the traveler. The balance designated to go to each is sent directly to the appropriate party. Don’t forget to double-check your card/account balance to ensure that split disbursement payments were properly paid.

2. **Use the bank’s online account access.**

    Payments can be made via the bank’s online bill payment system at any time – 24 hours a day, seven days a week – so you can pay the amount you owe on or before the due date directly from your own checking or savings account. Don’t forget that you still need to voucher through your agency/organization for official travel expenses incurred and receive reimbursement from your agency/organization. Note: Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) section 301-52.24 states that a card/account holder must remit payment to the bank on or before the statement due date, regardless of the status of the card/account holder’s voucher.

3. **Use the bank’s mobile app.**

    Payments can be made at any time via the bank’s mobile app. Download the bank’s mobile app to your device and pay through your checking or savings account on or before the statement due date. Note: You will still need to voucher through your agency/organization for official travel expenses incurred and receive reimbursement from your agency/organization to your savings or checking account.
