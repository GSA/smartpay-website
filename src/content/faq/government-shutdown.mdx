##  Account Holders
<Accordion  question="Can I use my GSA SmartPay account during a government-wide shutdown?" heading_level="h3">
It depends. Account holders are advised to check with your agency regarding the continued use of GSA SmartPay accounts due to a lapse in funding during a shutdown. You may not be authorized to use your accounts if your agency determines such use does not relate to excepted or exempted activities. 

The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits most agencies from incurring obligations in the absence of appropriations (unless otherwise allowed by law or for emergencies involving the safety of life or limb, the protection of property or other excepted/exempted services). Account holders should coordinate with the appropriate officials in their agency/organization to ensure only authorized travel and purchases are made during a lapse in funding.

Absent of any agency-specific action to limit account use, purchase, travel, fleet and integrated accounts will continue to function normally.

</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="Can I use my GSA SmartPay account for personal expenses?" heading_level="h3">
No, it is never appropriate to use your GSA SmartPay account for expenses not related to official government business. Doing so may result in your agency taking disciplinary action.
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="Will the banks’ 1-800 customer service call centers continue to operate?" heading_level="h3" >
Yes. If you need to reach your contractor bank during the shutdown, please call the 1-800 number on the back of your GSA SmartPay charge card.
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="Do I still have to pay my individually billed travel account statement if I am unable to pay due to the shutdown?">
In general, the answer is “no,” provided you are affected by the shutdown and therefore unable to pay. Payment would be required once funding is restored.  

In the event of a shutdown, the contractor banks recognize that affected agencies and account holders may be unable to make timely payments. Therefore, accounts could become past due until funding becomes available. For individually billed travel accounts in good standing as of the start of the shutdown, the contractor banks will:
- Keep accounts open unless deactivation is requested by agency officials.
- Take appropriate action to prevent accounts from becoming delinquent, suspended or canceled.
- vEnsure finance charges are not assessed.
- Waive all applicable late payment fees.
- Continue to generate account statements.
- Work with agencies to maintain risk mitigation measures.
- Coordinate with agencies and account holders to bring accounts up to date once funding becomes available.

The banks use highly automated account management processes that may require manual intervention by bank staff during a shutdown. As a result, isolated instances of errant activities such as the issuance of late payment notices on an account affected by the shutdown can occur. Should this happen, please follow your agency procedures or contact your servicing contractor bank as appropriate.

For accounts that were past due prior to the start of the shutdown, routine account management and payment rules apply.

Agencies may issue supplemental account holder guidance regarding individually billed account management and payments during a shutdown, consistent with applicable GSA SmartPay contract and task order terms.

</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="If I am late paying due to the shutdown, will the delayed payment on my individually billed travel account be reported to the credit bureaus?" heading_level="h3">
In general, the answer is “no.” Accounts in good standing as of the start of the shutdown will not be reported by the contractor banks to credit bureaus for late payment. Additionally, “past due” notices will not be issued and collection activities will not occur. However, statements of account will continue to be issued and will likely show a balance due. This balance does not need to be paid until funding becomes available. These measures apply only to account holders affected by the shutdown with accounts in good standing prior to the shutdown. For organizations (or components thereof) with funding, routine account management and payment rules apply. Generally, there is no need for individually billed GSA SmartPay travel account holders to contact the contractor banks in order for these shutdown measures to be implemented, but account holders should comply with instructions issued by their agency. GSA SmartPay participating agency Headquarters (HQ) account managers (or other authorized HQ staff) are advised to coordinate with their servicing GSA SmartPay contractor bank(s) to ensure a clear understanding of how the individually billed travel accounts impacted by the shutdown will be handled.

</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="What if my account was already delinquent before the shutdown? Will I be given more time to pay?" heading_level="h3">
No. Payment is due to the contractor bank per the statement due date. If your account was delinquent prior to the shutdown, it will continue to be considered delinquent until full payment is made to the contractor bank. The time elapsed after payment is due continues to accrue in the event of a government shutdown.
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="My card is about to expire. Will I receive my new card during a shutdown?" heading_level="h3">
Yes. In accordance with the terms of the GSA SmartPay Master Contract, if your card is due to expire during a shutdown, your new card will still be mailed. If your agency elects to have the charge card sent directly to you (for example, an individually billed travel card), then you will receive the card at the address on file. Or, your agency may elect to have the card mailed to the government offices for dissemination by an Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC) or other government employee. The card will most likely be held by the distributing government office until the shutdown is over. If you are deemed an exempt or excepted employee, your agency will most likely ensure card delivery to you, but we recommend that you confirm these procedures with the appropriate officials in your agency.

</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="What if I am traveling for work during a shutdown?" heading_level="h3">
Unless your agency takes action to limit or deactivate accounts, your travel account will continue to work during a shutdown. For government travelers on official travel that are recalled to return home due to shutdown, GSA SmartPay contractor banks operate under a “no-strand” policy. This policy ensures that accounts operate to support your return trip. But as policies vary, please be sure to check with your agency regarding travel during a shutdown.
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="What if I have recurring or automatic payments on my purchase account?" heading_level="h3">
Please coordinate with your agency’s finance officials and A/OPCs to ensure that these payments are properly addressed in the event of a shutdown. Be advised that purchase account holders may need to contact merchants to stop any automatic payments which may be scheduled to occur during the shutdown period.

The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits most agencies from incurring obligations in the absence of appropriations (unless otherwise allowed by law or for emergencies involving the safety of life or limb, the protection of property or other excepted/exempted activities). Account holders should therefore coordinate with the appropriate officials in their agency to ensure only authorized travel, purchases and payments are made in the event of a shutdown, as this issue can become especially complicated given the wide variety of agency missions, funding types, etc.

</Accordion>
## A/OPCs
<Accordion  question="Will GSA SmartPay accounts continue to operate normally during a shutdown to support authorized mission activities?" heading_level="h3">
Yes. The program will continue to operate normally in that accounts will function and GSA SmartPay contractor bank account management staff and systems, reporting, call centers, etc., will continue to operate.
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="Should agencies consider deactivating/reducing the spending limits for accounts not expected to be used during the shutdown?" heading_level="h3">
A/OPCs should consult with their contractor bank to help ensure appropriate internal control measures are maintained during a shutdown.
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="Does the Prompt Payment Act (PPA) apply to payments to the contractor banks?" heading_level="h3">
The PPA only applies to centrally billed accounts under the GSA SmartPay program. These account types include purchase, centrally billed travel, fleet and any centrally billed aspects of integrated accounts. PPA does not apply to individually billed accounts, as they do not constitute a federal government liability.  GSA SmartPay accounts will continue to function during a shutdown (except for those deactivated at agency direction) even though agencies may not be able to pay proper, official contractor bank invoices (which will continue to be generated) in a timely manner. Upon availability of funding, agencies must reconcile and pay these invoices as promptly as possible.
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="What if my agency wants to explore the temporary use of different GSA SmartPay account types during the shutdown (such as expanded use of centrally billed accounts)?" heading_level="h3">
Agencies should first consult with the GSA Center for Charge Card Management at [gsa_smartpay@gsa.gov](mailto:gsa_smartpay@gsa.gov). Changes in account types can lead to reconciliation challenges and affect dispute rights. All other potential implications should be fully explored and discussed prior to changes being made.
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="Even though individually billed account (IBA) travel accounts are an individual liability, what if employees affected by a shutdown are unable to pay their account statements? Should the agency coordinate with its GSA SmartPay servicing bank regarding this matter?" heading_level="h3">
In general, the answer is “no,” provided you are affected by the shutdown and therefore unable to pay. Payment would be required once funding is restored.  

In the event of a shutdown, the contractor banks recognize that affected agencies and account holders may be unable to make timely payments and accounts could therefore become past due until funding becomes available. For individually billed travel accounts in good standing as of the start of the shutdown, the contractor banks will:
- Keep accounts open unless deactivation is requested by agency officials.
- Take appropriate action to prevent accounts from becoming delinquent, suspended or canceled.
- Ensure finance charges are not assessed.
