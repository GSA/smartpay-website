# Merchant FAQ

<Accordion  question="Do I have to accept GSA SmartPay® accounts?" expand="true">
Merchants that wish to obtain a GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contract to do business with the government are required to accept GSA SmartPay payment solutions as a method of payment for [micro-purchases](https://www.gsa.gov/buy-through-us/purchasing-programs/gsa-multiple-award-schedule/schedule-buyers/purchase-card-holders).
 The rules and requirements for accepting payment solutions are defined by the card associations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="How can I promote the use of the GSA SmartPay program at my business?">
To promote the use of the GSA SmartPay payment solutions at their establishments, merchants can:
- **Provide point-of-sale discounts:** Offering a point of sale discount to government account holders is a great way to differentiate your business from others and to increase the amount of government purchases.
- **Provide Level 3 transaction data:** Merchants that provide Level 3 transaction data are more attractive to government agencies because the data enables agencies to keep track of their purchases more accurately. Merchants who wish to learn more about Level 3 data should contact their financial institution for more information.

<Accordion  question="How do I identify GSA SmartPay Accounts?">
Most GSA SmartPay Accounts will use government-specific designs and will display the GSA SmartPay logo, including the phrase “United States Government” or “For Official Use Only.”
The five standard card designs are displayed below:

<Accordion  question="How do I accept a GSA SmartPay account?">
GSA SmartPay accounts operate just like the commercial market. For example, if you already accept these forms of payment for non-government purchases, you can accept the GSA SmartPay payment solutions. The same previously negotiated transaction fees apply to GSA SmartPay transactions. 

GSA SmartPay account holders may carry the following brands: Mastercard, Visa, Voyager and Wright Express (WEX).

If you do not currently accept a particular form of payment, contact any financial institution to learn more about establishing a merchant account and maximizing your ability to capture government sales.

<Accordion  question="Is a merchant allowed to photocopy a GSA SmartPay charge card?">
Both Visa and Mastercard state in their guidelines that a merchant is allowed to make/store a photocopy of a charge card provided they do NOT record or copy the PIN and/or Card Verification Code (CVC) data in any manner or for any purpose.

Note: According to [U.S. Code Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 33, 701](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title18/part1/chapter33&edition=prelim), it is illegal for a merchant to photocopy a government ID.
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="Is the GSA SmartPay account tax exempt?">
In some cases, certain purchases made using a GSA SmartPay solution are exempt from taxes. Please visit the [SmartTax](smarttax/) section of the program website for more information on taxes.  
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="What if I am unable to accept a GSA SmartPay account?">
Businesses are required to label themselves by selecting a Merchant Category Code (MCC) that describes the products or services provided. Certain MCCs are blocked by agencies to prevent fraud and misuse. A business that has trouble accepting a GSA SmartPay account may be classified under a blocked MCC. To remedy this problem, merchants should talk to their financial institution to confirm that their MCC classification is accurate.
