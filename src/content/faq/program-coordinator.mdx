# Agency/Organization Program Coordinators (A/OPCs) FAQ

<Accordion  question="How do I connect with other A/OPCs to share ideas and best practices?" expand="true">
There are several ways to actively participate within the community:
- Attend the Quarterly A/OPC meetings, monthly “Discussions with Dave” calls, and other special meetings and events: Level 1 A/OPCs receive email invites to these meetings.
- Attend the annual GSA SmartPay Training Forum: Learn about all aspects of how to successfully manage your agency’s charge card program. Network, collaborate and share best practices with other card managers, bank representatives and GSA personnel.
</Accordion>
<Accordion  question="What can I do to improve my agency’s program performance?">
The GSA SmartPay program office provides a number of tools and types of assistance to support effective charge account program management across the government. Tips include:
- **Ensure policies are being followed:** Most agencies have comprehensive policies regarding the administration of their payment programs. This includes policies for account use as well as for program management. A/OPCs should ensure that the policies are clearly communicated and easily accessible to account holders. It is also important for agencies to follow through with the implementation of their policies, including distribution and compliance monitoring.
- **Make training a priority for all account holders and A/OPCs:**
  * GSA offers [free basic online training](https://training.smartpay.gsa.gov/) covering regulations and best practices for all agencies.
  * A variety of free resources to support account management are available on the GSA SmartPay program’s website.
  * Contact the bank to schedule an in-person or virtual Electronic Access System (EAS) training for your A/OPCs.
  * Consider attending the annual GSA SmartPay Training Forum, which provides a large variety of training for all A/OPCs and charge card management staff.   
- **Initiate an [Accounts Payable (A/P) File Review](https://youtu.be/KwVOP_Efzas):** An A/P File Review, performed by the contractor bank, is a no-cost tool to help agencies identify opportunities to leverage GSA SmartPay solutions as methods of payment to increase process efficiencies, cost savings and refunds.
- **Participate in Workgroups:** The GSA Center for Charge Card Management (CCCM) sponsors periodic workgroups to facilitate the sharing of information between agencies and to collect feedback on the performance of the GSA SmartPay program office and its contractor banks.

<Accordion  question="How do I go about incorporating a new payment solution into my program?">
Under the GSA SmartPay program, there are many options available to assist your agency in meeting your mission critical needs.  Products and related services under the GSA SmartPay program can offer customized payment solutions to help your agency achieve its goals. Under the GSA SmartPay Master Contract, each participating agency tags, joins a pool agreement, or awards its own task order to one of the contractor banks. Not all products and services offered under the GSA SmartPay program may be available to your agency, as each agency's task order is different and unique. For this reason, it is important to review your agency's task order. In addition, speak to those within your agency that are responsible for managing your agency’s task order, such as your Level 1 A/OPC and the task order’s Contracting Officer.

<Accordion question="What policies exist regarding the use of the GSA SmartPay payment solutions?">
The [Treasury Financial Manual](https://tfm.fiscal.treasury.gov/) is the Department of the Treasury’s official publication of policies, procedures and instructions concerning financial management in the federal government. 

There are a number of policies that govern the use of government payment solutions, including:
- Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).
- Federal Travel Regulations (FTR).
- Federal Management Regulations (FMR).
- OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B.
- Public Law.
- American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

For more information on the policies listed above, visit the [Policies and Legislation page](/policies-and-audits/policies).

Additionally, many agencies have regulations that are specific to their program and tailored to their agency's mission and operating procedures.

<Accordion  question="What can agencies/organizations do to help prevent misuse of accounts? What tools are available to provide assistance to agencies in detecting fraud and misuse?">
Mandating training that meets governmentwide standards for account holders and A/OPCs is the first step to preventing misuse. Currently, training varies widely among agencies, with many agencies relying on the training provided at the annual GSA SmartPay Training Forum and the online courses on the GSA SmartPay Training website. While these training courses review the necessary governmentwide rules and regulations, they do not reflect agency-specific requirements, which are important for account holders to know.

The GSA SmartPay Master Contract includes a number of tools that support agencies in controlling and monitoring account spend to prevent fraud, waste and abuse. Examples of these tools are:
- **Credit limits:** Restrict single purchase, daily, weekly or monthly expenditures by the account holders. In accordance with agency policy, limits are set to meet the agency needs.
- **Merchant Category Code (MCC) Blocks:** Established by the bankcard associations to classify different types of businesses. Merchants are assigned codes that describe their primary line of business. Agencies can limit the types of businesses where account holders are permitted to make purchases by limiting the MCCs available to account holders.
- **Reports:** Agencies have access to online management reports via their contractor bank’s Electronic Access System (EAS). Standard reports include Account Activity, Dispute, Unusual Spending Activity, Lost/Stolen Cards and Ad Hoc reports.
- **Guidebooks:** The banks are required to provide written A/OPC guides that serve as a stand-alone reference for A/OPCs to conduct program management for the GSA SmartPay Program. Topics include procedures for account setup and maintenance, account suspension/cancellation, transaction disputes and reconciliation. Agencies also have access to account holder, Designated Billing Office and Transaction Dispute Office guides from banks.
