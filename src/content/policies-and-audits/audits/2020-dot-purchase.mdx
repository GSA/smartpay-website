## Background

According to U.S. Bank, DOT employees made more than 327,000 purchase card transactions—totaling $223.7 million—from October 2016 through March 2018. The objectives of this audit were to:

- Test existing controls to determine if they provide reasonable assurance that improper purchases are prevented or detected in the normal course of business.
- Evaluate DOT’s policies and procedures for oversight of its purchase card program.

## Recommendations

Thirteen recommendations were made to assist DOT in improving its oversight of the purchase card program and increasing the effectiveness of its internal controls.
