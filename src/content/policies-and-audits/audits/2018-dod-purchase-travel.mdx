## Background

OMB reporting requirements use the word misuse as a broad term that includes various categories of improper transactions such as fraud, waste, abuse, personal use, other loss and misappropriations of funds or assets. This audit was the third report the DoD OIG has produced regarding travel card misuse. It focused on purchase card and travel card reports that the DoD was required to submit to OMB.

## Recommendations

It was recommended that DoD:

- Obtain, review and oversee transaction level details for misuse to improve reporting.
- Complete an evaluation of the costs and benefits of Purchase Card Online System (PCOLS).
- Revise the Government Travel Charge Card Regulations by the Director of DTMO to require Component Program Managers (CPMs) and designated agency program coordinators to use available contractual tools, to include the Visa IntelliLink rules, queries and case disposition modules.
