## Card/Account Type 
To identify cards/accounts, it is important to know whether a card/account is a Centrally Billed Account (CBA) or Individually Billed Account (IBA).

### For CBAs: 
- Agency is invoiced for purchases.
- Payments are made directly to the contractor banks by the federal government.
- Examples include purchase, fleet, and some travel cards/accounts.

### For IBAs:
- Card/account holder is invoiced directly.
- Payment is the responsibility of the card/account holder, who is then reimbursed by the agency/organization.
- Most common travel cards/accounts.

##  Card/Account Prefix
The prefix is the first four digits that appear on the charge card/account.

##  Bank Identification Number (BIN)
The BIN is the first six digits that appear on the charge card/account.

##  Travel Cards/Accounts
GSA SmartPay Travel cards/accounts can be used for official government travel and travel-related expenses, while allowing card/account holders access to GSA's [City Pair Program](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-a-trip/transportation-airfare-rates-pov-rates-etc/airfare-rates-city-pair-program) reduced airfares. 

### Travel Card Designs
Typically, travel cards have one of these designs:
