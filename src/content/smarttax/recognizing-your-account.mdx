The most reliable way to identify GSA SmartPay® Purchase and Fleet charge cards is through the four digit bank identification number (BIN). In order to recognize GSA SmartPay Travel, Tax Advantage Travel, and Integrated cards, please refer to the six-digit BIN.

##  Travel Account
The GSA SmartPay Travel account can be used for official government travel and travel-related expenses, while allowing account holders access to GSA City Pair Program reduced airfares. Agencies and organizations are able to reduce travel processing costs and earn refunds, as annual spend has nearly tripled since the program’s inception in 1998. GSA SmartPay Travel account revenue funds the GSA City Pair reduced cost airline ticket program.

### Travel Account Types
Some states provide tax exemption on individually billed Travel accounts (IBA). To determine whether the Travel or Integrated account is a CBA, IBA, or Tax Advantage Travel account, refer to the sixth digit of the account number. The sixth digit identifier that differentiates CBA and IBA accounts is specific to Travel accounts and does not apply to other GSA SmartPay business lines.

Travel cards may have two different designs:

### Tax Exemption Status
All GSA SmartPay Fleet accounts are centrally billed and should be exempt from state tax assessment.

#### Rental Car Exemption Information
U.S. Government Rental Car Agreement Number 4 states that the government may receive tax exemption for centrally billed accounts if there is prior coordination between the account manager and the rental car company. Therefore, agencies should seek tax exemption when using a centrally billed card. This exemption must also be documented in the rental agreement. Although individually billed accounts are not mentioned in U.S. Government Rental Car Agreement Number 4, travelers should work with the rental car company before they travel so they can receive sales tax exemption in the 11 states which exempt IBA cards.
