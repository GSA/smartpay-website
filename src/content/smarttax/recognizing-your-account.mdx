## Card/Account Type 
To identify cards/accounts, it is important to know whether a card/account is a Centrally Billed Account (CBA) or Individually Billed Account (IBA).

### For CBAs: 
- Agency is invoiced for purchases.
- Payments are made directly to the contractor banks by the federal government.
- Examples include purchase, fleet, and some travel cards/accounts.

### For IBAs:
- Card/account holder is invoiced directly.
- Payment is the responsibility of the card/account holder, who is then reimbursed by the agency/organization.
- Most common travel cards/accounts.

##  Bank Identification Number (BIN)
The BIN is the first four to six numbers that appear on the charge card/account.

The most reliable way to identify GSA SmartPay Travel and Tax Advantage Travel cards/accounts is through the six-digit BIN.

The most reliable way to identify GSA SmartPay Purchase, Fleet, and Integrated charge cards/accounts is through the four-digit BIN. 

##  Travel Cards/Accounts
GSA SmartPay Travel cards/accounts can be used for official government travel and travel-related expenses, while allowing card/account holders access to GSA's [City Pair Program](https://www.gsa.gov/plan-book/transportation-airfare-pov-etc/airfare-rates-city-pair-program) reduced airfares. 

### Travel Card Designs
Typically, travel cards have one of these designs:

## Purchase Cards/Accounts
In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the GSA SmartPay Purchase card/account is the preferred method to purchase and pay for micro-purchases (FAR Part 13.201).

#### Rental Car Exemption Information

Therefore, agencies should seek tax exemption when using CBAs. This exemption must also be documented in the rental agreement. Although IBAs are not mentioned in U.S. Government Rental Car Agreement Number 4, travelers should work with the rental car company before they travel so they can receive sales tax exemption in the states which exempt IBAs.

## Integrated Cards/Accounts
The GSA SmartPay integrated account is a specialized card/account designed to combine the functions of the purchase, travel, and fleet business lines into one payment solution.

### Integrated Card Designs
Typically, integrated cards have this design:
