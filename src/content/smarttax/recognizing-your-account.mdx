##  Bank Identification Number (BIN)
The most reliable way to identify GSA SmartPay Purchase and Fleet charge cards/accounts is through the four digit BIN. In order to recognize GSA SmartPay Travel, Tax Advantage Travel, and Integrated cards/accounts, please refer to the six-digit BIN.

## Centrally Billed Accounts (CBAs) vs. Individually Billed Accounts (IBAs)
It is also important to know whether a card/account is a CBA or IBA.

### For CBAs: 
- Agency is invoiced for purchases.
- Payments are made directly to the contractor banks by the federal government.
- Examples include purchase, fleet, and some travel cards/accounts.

### For IBAs:
- Card/account holder is invoiced directly.
- Payment is the responsibility of the card/account holder, who is then reimbursed by the agency/organization.
- Most common travel cards/accounts.

##  Travel Cards/Accounts
The GSA SmartPay Travel cards/accounts can be used for official government travel and travel-related expenses, while allowing card/account holders access to GSA City Pair Program reduced airfares. Agencies and organizations are able to reduce travel processing costs and earn refunds, as annual spend has nearly tripled since the program’s inception in 1998. GSA SmartPay Travel card/account revenue funds the GSA City Pair reduced cost airline ticket program.

### Travel Card/Account Types
Some states provide tax exemption on individually billed accounts (IBA) for travel. To determine whether the Travel or Integrated card/account is a CBA, IBA, or Tax Advantage Travel card/account, refer to the sixth digit of the card/account number. The sixth digit identifier that differentiates CBA and IBA cards/accounts is specific to Travel cards/accounts and does not apply to other GSA SmartPay business lines.

Travel cards may have three different designs:

### Tax Exemption Status
Federal government travelers using GSA SmartPay IBA Travel cards/accounts may be exempt from state taxes in select states. In addition, state tax exemption forms, official business travel documentation or a federal government identification may be required to receive state tax exemption. 


## Purchase Cards/Accounts
In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the GSA SmartPay Purchase card/account is the preferred method to purchase and pay for micro-purchases (FAR Part 13.201).  For purchases above the micro-purchase threshold, the Purchase card/account may be used as an ordering and payment mechanism, but not as a contracting mechanism. 

Purchase cards may have two different designs:  

![Red charge card with the word Purchase and numbers 1234 5678 9012 3456 and the name John Smith, with a bird in the background](/images/red-card.png)
![Yellow charge card with the word Intergrated and numbers 1234 5678 9012 3456 and the name John Smith, with a globe outline in the background](/images/yellow-card.png)

| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Visa       | 4614, 4716       |
| Mastercard | 5565, 5568       |


### Tax Exemption Status
All GSA SmartPay Purchase cards/accounts are centrally billed and should be exempt from state sales tax. The sixth-digit identifier used to differentiate Travel and Integrated cards/accounts does not apply to Purchase cards/accounts or Fleet cards/accounts.  


## Fleet Cards/Accounts
Use of GSA SmartPay Fleet cards/accounts enable agencies/organizations to conveniently obtain fuel and maintenance for vehicles and equipment, as well as manage tax-recovery efforts and collect detailed fleet management data.

Fleet cards may have two different designs:

![Green charge card with the word Fleet and numbers 1234 5678 9012 3456 and the name John Smith, with a road in the background](/images/green-card.png)

| WEX        | 5565, 6900, 7071 |

### Tax Exemption Status
All GSA SmartPay Fleet cards/accounts are centrally billed and should be exempt from state tax assessment.

#### Rental Car Exemption Information
U.S. Government Rental Car Agreement Number 4 states that the government may receive tax exemption for CBAs if there is prior coordination between the account manager and the rental car company. Therefore, agencies should seek tax exemption when using a centrally billed card/account. This exemption must also be documented in the rental agreement. Although IBAs are not mentioned in U.S. Government Rental Car Agreement Number 4, travelers should work with the rental car company before they travel so they can receive sales tax exemption in the 11 states which exempt IBA cards/accounts.
