## Maximize Your GSA SmartPay® Payments Program through Strategic Payment Solutions

The GSA SmartPay program is dedicated to maximizing efficiency and increasing savings and refunds for customer agencies. That’s
why the GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract includes more strategic payment solutions than ever before to take your program to
the next level, many of which are included at no additional cost to your agency. Strategic payment solutions will allow you to gain
efficiencies on current spend, capture additional spend, increase refunds, improve oversight and control, and gain transparency and
accountability within your program.


The GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract was awarded to two contractors: Citibank® and U.S. Bank®. Agencies subsequently awarded
a task order to one of the two GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract banks. The strategic payment solutions described in this folder
are available to your agency under the Master Contract, however, it is important to confirm that these solutions have also been
included in your agency’s task order before working to implement the solutions. This can be done by contacting your Level 1 Agency/
Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC) or your agency’s GSA SmartPay task order Contracting Officer.


Once you review the available strategic payment solution offerings, it is important to contact your GSA SmartPay contractor bank to
ask for additional information on the specific offerings outlined in your task order. The GSA SmartPay contractor bank can provide
your agency with specific commercial or government examples of how the payment solution offerings could be utilized within your
program. The contractor bank can also provide you with assistance by completing an Accounts Payable File Review (A/P File Review).

### What is a “Card-Not-Present Solution” and what solutions are available under the GSA SmartPay program?

A card-not-present solution is a mechanism to complete a transaction without having a physical card in place. As the payment
marketplace embraces more digital transactions, card-not-present solutions are becoming more and more common. Consumers and commercial entities alike have transitioned to making a large portion of their purchases online as opposed to in person at a brick-andmortar
location. Federal agencies are following suit and the trend toward online purchasing continues to grow. In addition, many commercial entities have implemented digital payment options at their physical locations.

The GSA SmartPay program offers several different strategic
payment solutions for agencies to consider, including:

- Declining Balance Cards
- Ghost Cards
- Mobile Payments
- Single Use Accounts

Now that we know the card-not-present offerings offered under the GSA SmartPay Master Contract, let’s discuss the differences and benefits of each of these strategic payment solutions.

## Card-Not-Present Solutions and Benefits

### Declining Balance Cards
Declining balance cards have the same functionality as a charge card,
but the limits on the declining balance cards do not have to refresh
each month. Declining balance cards are a central liability and thus
are paid for by the agency/organization much like the Purchase or
Travel Centrally Billed Accounts (CBAs). This type of card can be used
for a specific purpose or for a specified time period and with a pre-
determined credit limit. The credit limit can be reset as needed, set for
a specified time, or become inactive once the balance is depleted.


A declining balance card allows for greater oversight and control.
Like with a traditional centrally billed payment solution, an agency
pays for the amount designated on the card as the card is depleted
(and not when the card is set up and the limit designated), and
therefore it would not be considered an advanced payment. Similar
authorization controls, such as MCC blocks, can be used on these
types of cards in the same way that they are used to control the
traditional GSA SmartPay Program cards.

It is important to note that although we categorize a declining
balance card as a potential “card-not-present” payment solution,
your agency may want to utilize this solution in the form of a
traditional plastic charge card. One example of an agency utilizing
the solution this way is the Department of Health and Human
Services’ (HHS) GO!card™. GO!card is a declining balance solution
for HHS's transit subsidy program. It replaced a traditional paper
check system for federal government employees receiving transit
benefits. The program has reduced administrative costs by eliminating the manual processes associated with issuing paper
checks and vouchers for transit subsidies and, combined with the
“no waste” feature of declining balance cards, is currently yielding
an average of 26 percent cost savings over the previous program.

### Ghost Cards

A ghost card is an account number that is specific to an agency or an
entity within an agency. The term “card” can be misleading because
there is not a need for a plastic card for the transactions. A ghost
card is a CBA that is designated specifically for a supplier frequentlyutilized by an agency, allowing for any authorized agency personnel to purchase from the vendor without having to use multiple cards or accounts. The ghost card is typically managed in a central location by one office/department within an agency. A ghost card allows for an agency to consolidate purchases to a single vendor under one account, aiding in reconciliation as well as transaction oversight. Agencies can utilize ghost cards for purchases such as booking airfare for travelers and for paying utilities. It is important to note that accounts issued in the agency or department name, instead of an individual’s name, have different chargeback and dispute rights. Similar to the declining balance card, agencies may consider the option to utilize this solution in the form of a traditional plastic charge card. Agencies should ensure that they check with their GSA SmartPay contractor bank for additional details.

One example of utilization of the ghost card solution is Department of Commerce’s (DOC) Department Virtual Payment Cards. These cards allow DOC to pay UPS orders via GSA’s Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) Document Delivery Service BPA. This innovative solution improves operational efficiencies, reduces administrative costs, and allows DOC to earn additional refunds.

As a best practice, agency employees responsible for ghost cards should work closely with the vendor to ensure that the vendor is capable of passing a minimum of Level 2 data in order to aide in the reconciliation process. Centrally billed travel accounts, for example, utilize the passenger name in order to aide in reconciliation.

### Mobile Payments

Mobile payments allow agencies to make secure payments utilizing a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone) at the point of sale. Essentially, a mobile payment is a version of a charge card loaded onto a mobile device so that the account holder doesn’t have to carry a plastic charge card. Mobile payment utilization has increased drastically in the consumer card industry and has started to gain traction in the corporate card industry. Many brick-and-mortar retailers accept some form of mobile payments.Under the GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract, mobile payments are offered to your agency at no additional charge. It is important, however, to note that each agency must determine their own policies and procedures regarding the implementation of mobile payments. For example, your agency must determine whether mobile payments are allowable for CBA accounts and/or IBA accounts. In addition, it’s important to review the types of mobile devices for implementation. If your agency provides employees with mobile devices, they may have a policy that allows for mobile payments to be authorized only on agency-owned mobile devices. However, if your agency does not provide employees with mobile devices, they may determine that individual account holders will be authorized to utilize mobile payments on their personal devices.

### Single Use Accounts

Single use accounts allow an agency to utilize a virtual account number for a single payment. The limit on each single use account is equal to the single payment amount. A single use account can provide your agency with a precise set of controls surrounding a single payment, including establishing the virtual account number for a single dollar amount, a limited amount of time, MCC blocks, and account expiration dates. Agencies also have the ability to append accounting data for seamless reconciliation. Similar declining balance cards and ghost cards, agencies may consider the option to utilize this solution in the form of a traditional plastic charge card.

Single use accounts are a great option for agencies looking to reduce the number of convenience checks being written. By utilizing an account number one time, the agency reduces the risk of fraud as compared to convenience checks, while increasing oversight into the payment data.

Single use accounts are a great option for agencies looking to expand contract payments through the charge card program. They allow agencies to make invoice payments to a specific vendor for a specific invoice and include controls to ensure that the vendor only receives the invoice amount. Agencies can greatly maximize refunds by moving these types of payments to single use accounts.
