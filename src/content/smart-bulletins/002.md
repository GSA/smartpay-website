## Introduction

In accordance with the [Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.2 - Actions At or Below the Micro-Purchase Threshold](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-13.2), “The Government wide commercial purchase card shall be the preferred method to purchase and to pay for micro-purchases.” The purpose of this GSA SmartPay Smart Bulletin is to provide information to charge card managers, cardholders, and stakeholders about the government micro-purchase threshold. 


## Definition

In accordance with [FAR 2.101 Definitions](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-2.1#FAR_2_101), a “Micro-purchase means an acquisition of supplies or services using simplified acquisition procedures, the aggregate amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold.” The micro-purchase threshold limit is established in [FAR 2.101 Definitions](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-2.1#FAR_2_101). Convenience checks may not be issued for an amount in excess of one half of the micro-purchase threshold under [41 U.S.C. chapter 12, Simplified Acquisition Procedures](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title41/subtitle1/divisionB/chapter19&edition=prelim).


## Exceptions

[FAR 2.101 Definitions](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-2.1#FAR_2_101) establishes the micro-purchase threshold limit. However there are exceptions to this limit, which are each defined and the threshold is established in the definition of micro-purchase threshold in [FAR 2.101 Definitions](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-2.1#FAR_2_101). These include the following:

- **Construction:** Defined under construction and subject to [40 U.S.C. chapter 31, subchapter IV, Wage Rate Requirements](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title40/subtitle2/partA/chapter31/subchapter4&edition=prelim).
- **Services:** Subject to [41 U.S.C. chapter 67, Service Contract Labor Standards](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title41/subtitle2/chapter67&edition=prelim).
- **Contingency Operations:** Defined under contingency operations and [10 U.S.C. 101, Definitions](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:10%20section:101%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section101)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true). Please see [FAR 2.101 Definitions](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-2.1#FAR_2_101) for micro-purchase limits for purchases within the United States and purchases made outside of the United States.
- **Higher Education:** Acquisitions of supplies or services from institutions of higher education or related or affiliated nonprofit entities, or from nonprofit research organizations or independent research institutes.


## Action
Agencies are not required to designate purchase limits at the maximum micro-purchase limits established by the FAR. Instead, agencies should consider evaluating current procurement needs, established spending controls, and current purchase card spending limits to determine whether or setting spending limits at the micro-purchase threshold is required to meet the needs of an agency.
