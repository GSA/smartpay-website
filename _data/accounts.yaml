GSA SmartPay travel account revenue funds the GSA City Pair reduced cost airline ticket program."

  rental_car_exmption: "U.S. Government Rental Car Agreement Number 4 states that the government may receive tax exemption for centrally billed accounts if there is prior coordination between the account manager and the rental car company. Therefore, agencies should seek tax exemption when using a centrally billed card. This exemption must also be documented in the rental agreement. Although individually billed accounts are not mentioned in U.S. Government Rental Car Agreement Number 4, travelers should work with the rental car company before they travel so they can receive sales tax exemption in the 11 states which exempt IBA cards."
